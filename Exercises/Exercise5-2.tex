\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create several models and fit them on the Boston housing dataset. See how correlated their errors are. Fit two voting ensembles, one using all estimators and one where you remove one of the two estimators whose predictions are most correlated with each other.\newline\linebreak
	\textbf{Note:} Feel free to also try this out on other datasets (particularly larger datasets with more observations), as well as also porting this problem to classification and focus on finding the classifiers whose classification mistakes are often similar (e.g. on the MNIST dataset when one wrongly predicts a 7, the other also often wrongly predicts a 7)
